//! The configuration: the schema of section 7 of SPEC, reading, writing, defaults and
//! version migration. The settings dialog is the other half of this module and arrives
//! with stage E8.
//!
//! Responsibility taken from the module table in section 6.2 of SPEC.
//!
//! Requirements covered here: the configuration schema of section 7 of SPEC, in full
//! (task T-01-3). Still to come: FR-92 and FR-93, the settings dialog (task T-08-1), and
//! FR-94, hotkey capture with RU and EN localisation (task T-08-2). The distribution of
//! requirements over modules follows the backlog, which is its source of truth
//! (decision R-17).
//!
//! SEC-01 and SEC-07. This is the only module of the program that writes to disk at all.
//! Nothing derived from a keystroke, from a converted character or from the clipboard is
//! part of the schema, and none of it may reach an error message either: a damaged
//! configuration file can hold anything whatsoever, so a parse failure is reported by
//! position alone and never quotes what it read.
